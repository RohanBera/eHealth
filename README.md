# eHealth
App with backend

Fresh start.
This time I'll only upload the files in www directory.
And the final APK probably.

## Plans 

#### Users 

* Patients
* Doctors

#### Functions

* Both can register and login.
* Patients can see doctors registered with the app.
* Patients can see on which days doctors are free
* And patients can apply for appointments.
* Doctors can view appointments.

App seems pretty straight-forward after writing this readme file.
I'll be using web sql and local storage to store the info.
Web sql part can be replaced with db of choice, I guess.
